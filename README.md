# RaidHelper
AutoHotKey GUI to help automate some things in Raid

It looks for colors in the Raid window (Plariums desktop app), and clicks them. E.g. looks for the color of the different buttons to see if they are present etc.

Maximize your Raid window for best results atm.

While farming levels in campaign (Farm tab) items are sold, only from 12 though, I can add other items later if needed.

Download and install AutoHotKey and run RaidHelper.ahk

If you activate a lot of options under auto at the same time, the different options might make your champs accidentaly target spiderlings etc. So activate as few options as possible to do what you need.

Some options are saved when you close the app so you don't have to change them from the default all the time.

Small demo of the arena picker and auto ai to automatically attack a whole page in TagTeamArena.
If you lose it will attack again and use all your tokens. Might make it a bit smarter in the future if needed.
